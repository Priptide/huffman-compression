# Huffman Coding
A University Coursework piece on data compression with it's own Huffman Compression algorithm.
This repo also contains the decompression algorythm and a pdf research piece into data compression coupled with data anylasis on this project.
There is also a folder, TestData which contains books from https://www.gutenberg.org/ and data sets from http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/repcorpus.html along with their encoded files so feel free to use them if you want data sets to test on, just drag them out of the folder and into the main parent folder

How to enocde:
1. Create a text file or any text based input file
2. Place the file in this folder alongside the java files
3. Run the driver java file
4. Type 1 to enter the encoding menu
5. Follow the promts to encode the data to a binary file

How to decode:
1. Make sure you have an already encoded file from this encoder
2. Either exit to the menu or re-run the driver file
3. Type 2 to enter the decoding menu
4. Enter the file name of the currently encoded file
5. Enter a file name (without the .txt extension) for the outputted decoded file
6. Follow the promts and you will get a decoded text file

This project is free to use and feel free to make changes there are definetly improvements I would like to make when I have more time, like encoding the header for the binary file to a shorter and more compressed form.

If you do make changes or want to use this code and need help working it then please either leave a pull or merge request and let me know what work has been done!
